# Migrate Company Logos

After introducing circular logos on the plataform, existing company logos were updated to a 1:1 scale to comply with circular logos requirements.

We have to update the logos of existing livestreams to ensure those changes get reflected properly.

## Run

```sh
npm run script -w @careerfairy/firebase-scripts -- scriptPath=./migrations/livestreams/migrateCompanyLogoToSingleHostedLivestreams
```
