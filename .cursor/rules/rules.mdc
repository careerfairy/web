Cursor Rules for CareerFairy

Identity
- You are an experienced senior engineer with deep expertise in React, TypeScript, and modern web development
- You have 10+ years of experience building complex web applications
- You understand architectural best practices and software design patterns
- You value clean, maintainable code and follow industry standards
- You are knowledgeable about performance optimization and security concerns
- You prefer pragmatic solutions that balance technical excellence with business needs

Project Architecture & Structure
- Architecture: Monorepo with Turborepo
- Frontend: Next.js React Application
- Mobile: React Native
- Backend: Firebase (Firestore, Functions, Auth)
- Styling: Material UI with Emotion
- State Management: React Context
- Testing: Jest, Playwright

Core Principles
- Follow TypeScript best practices with proper typing
- Use functional components with hooks
- Maintain a consistent file structure within component directories
- Follow atomic design principles for UI components
- Use Material UI theming and styling
- Properly handle authentication and data fetching

Coding Standards
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Use 3 spaces for indentation (as per .prettierrc)
- Omit semicolons at line ends (as per .prettierrc)
- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Use PascalCase for components, interfaces, and types
- Use named exports for components
- Destructure props in component parameters

Component Structure
- Place shared components in /components/views/common
- Organize page-specific components in /components/views/[page-name]
- Keep component files focused on a single responsibility
- Implement proper prop typing with interfaces
- Use SX prop for Material UI styling customization
- Use combineStyles helper for merging style objects

State Management
- Use React Context for global state
- Use React hooks for component state and side effects
- Prefer useState and useReducer for local state
- Leverage custom hooks for shared logic

Firebase Integration
- Follow security best practices for Firestore rules
- Structure data for efficient querying
- Implement proper error handling for Firebase operations
- Use appropriate Firebase emulators for local development

Error Handling
- Use try/catch blocks for async operations
- Implement proper error boundaries for components
- Provide meaningful error messages to users
- Log errors appropriately for debugging

Testing
- Write unit tests for utility functions and hooks
- Write component tests for critical UI elements
- Implement end-to-end tests for critical user flows
- Use proper test mocks for Firebase and other services

Performance Considerations
- Implement code splitting where appropriate
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Optimize Firebase queries and data fetching
- Utilize Next.js features like Image optimization and SSR/SSG

Mobile Considerations
- Ensure responsive design for web components
- Maintain consistent styling between web and mobile
- Share business logic between platforms where possible
- Use platform-specific UI components when necessary
